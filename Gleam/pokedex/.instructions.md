Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow for Gleam + Lustre functional programming project.

# Instructions

## Functional Programming Principles
- Use pure functions wherever possible
- Prefer immutable data structures over mutable state
- Use pattern matching extensively for control flow
- Leverage Gleam's type system for compile-time safety
- Use pipe operators |> for function composition
- Avoid side effects in business logic functions
- Use Result and Option types for error handling instead of exceptions

## Gleam-Specific Guidelines
- Follow Gleam naming conventions (snake_case for functions and variables)
- Use descriptive module names that reflect their purpose
- Leverage Gleam's built-in types: List, Result, Option, Bool, Int, Float, String
- Use custom types for domain modeling
- Prefer case expressions over if/else chains
- Use guards in pattern matching when appropriate
- Utilize Gleam's actor model for concurrent programming
- Use external functions sparingly and document FFI calls clearly

## Lustre Framework Patterns
- Follow the Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture strictly
- Keep update functions pure - no side effects
- Use commands (Cmd) for side effects like HTTP requests
- Structure view functions to be composable and reusable
- Use event handlers that return clear, typed messages
- Leverage Lustre's element builders for type-safe HTML
- Use subscriptions for external event streams
- Keep component state minimal and well-typed

## Code Organization
- Organize code into logical modules by domain
- Separate pure business logic from UI concerns
- Use type aliases for complex function signatures
- Document public functions with clear examples
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Group related functionality in the same module

## Error Handling
- Use Result(a, e) for operations that can fail
- Use Option(a) for values that might be absent
- Avoid panicking - handle all error cases explicitly
- Chain Result operations using try expressions
- Provide meaningful error messages with custom error types

## Performance Considerations
- Use tail recursion for iterative operations
- Leverage Gleam's lazy evaluation where beneficial
- Avoid unnecessary data copying
- Use efficient data structures for the use case
- Profile and measure before optimizing

# Domain Knowledge

## Gleam Language Features
- Static typing with type inference
- Pattern matching with exhaustiveness checking
- Actor-based concurrency model
- Immutable data structures by default
- Compile-time guarantees for runtime safety
- FFI support for JavaScript and Erlang targets
- Built-in support for Result and Option types

## Lustre Framework Concepts
- Model: Application state representation
- View: Pure functions that render state to HTML
- Update: Pure functions that transform state based on messages
- Commands: Side effects wrapped in a controlled manner
- Subscriptions: External event streams (timers, websockets, etc.)
- Effects: Managed side effects that return messages
- Components: Reusable UI elements with their own MVU cycle

## Web Development Patterns
- Unidirectional data flow
- Event-driven architecture
- Declarative UI rendering
- State management through message passing
- Type-safe routing and navigation
- Form handling with validation
- HTTP client patterns with proper error handling

## Best Practices
- Always handle both success and error cases in Results
- Use custom types to model domain concepts precisely
- Prefer composition over inheritance (via modules and functions)
- Write tests for pure functions using Gleam's built-in test framework
- Use descriptive type names that reflect business concepts
- Document complex business rules in code comments
- Keep HTML generation functions pure and predictable

```

## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for all identifiers
- Use descriptive names that reflect business concepts
- Prefix types with domain context when necessary
- Use verbs for functions, nouns for data
- Use Result and Option suffixes for wrapped types

## Dependencies Management
- Prefer core Gleam libraries over external dependencies
- Document why external dependencies are chosen
- Keep dependency tree minimal and focused
- Use specific version constraints in gleam.toml
- Regularly update dependencies for security

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all pure functions
- Test error cases explicitly
- Use property-based testing for complex logic
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Maintain high test coverage for business logic
- Test UI components by testing their output HTML

# Code Examples

## Typical Model Definition
```gleam
pub type Model {
  Model(
    users: List(User),
    loading: Bool,
    error: Option(String),
    selected_user: Option(User)
  )
}
```

## Update Function Pattern
```gleam
pub fn update(model: Model, msg: Msg) -> #(Model, Cmd(Msg)) {
  case msg {
    LoadUsers -> #(Model(..model, loading: True), load_users_cmd())
    UsersLoaded(Ok(users)) -> #(Model(..model, users: users, loading: False), Cmd.none())
    UsersLoaded(Error(err)) -> #(Model(..model, error: Some(err), loading: False), Cmd.none())
    SelectUser(user) -> #(Model(..model, selected_user: Some(user)), Cmd.none())
  }
}
```

## View Function Pattern
```gleam
pub fn view(model: Model) -> Html(Msg) {
  div([], [
    h1([], [text("Users")]),
    case model.loading {
      True -> div([class("loading")], [text("Loading...")])
      False -> user_list(model.users)
    }
  ])
}
```
